Has technology ever been more exciting than in the last few decades? Smartphones, social-media and deep learning would be popular examples that have changed the world. Quantum-computing, augmented reality and gene-editing are a few examples that might join the list in our lifetime.

But down here I’ll just list the developments that have actually inspired me to study electrical and computer engineering.

**Solar cells:** In the mid-2000s, a formidable solar cell industry had emerged in Germany. The utopian promise of endless, sustainable energy got one step closer and Germany seemed ready to profit from it. However, the downfall of companies like Solarworld and Q-Cells against cheaper cells mainly by Chinese companies will go on to serve as a cautionary tale against the lack of a larger political strategic framework for such industries.

**Nintendo Wii:** In the end of 2006, a new game console with a quirky name arrived on the market: The Nintendo Wii. It is hard to believe successful the console would become, when you start by listing all the things it did *not* do. Its graphics were not even close to the contemporary Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3. It did not play Blue-Ray discs. The system for online gaming was complicated to say the least. But it did one thing right: An innovative, intuitive control that could be grasped by a six-year old child.

**Google Search:** Last but not least, Google Search. The first search engine that did not clutter your screen before you even entered a query. All based on PageRank, an elegant algorithm that gave revolutionary good results and scaled with the growth of the internet. Knowledge would only be a few keystrokes away for all of us.

Of course, both time and technology moved on and I am still keen to stay in the middle of it. On here you will find the some results of my findings, share the things that I do know, and also show a portfolio of my side-projects. Below you can find a list of things I will do and write about.

##### List of Things To Do:
* ~~Create a personal page and start a blog.~~
* Design consumer electronics and get it mass-produced.
* Make a Kickstarter campaign.
* Create a company.
* Get a trademark.
* Get a patent.



I will keep y’all posted.

In the meantime: Stay safe and keep on rocking!
